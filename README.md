## Overview

The third WDI project was to work in a team to deliver a fully-functional user-generated CMS (Content Management System) that includes multiple relationships between database models and consumes at least one public API (Application Programming Interface).


## Team

## Technical Acceptance Criteria

1. The app must deliver something of value to the end-user with a visually impressive design, ideally should be mobile responsive.

2. It should store user generated content (UGC) by authenticated users who login to upload content they have generated

3. Users must have a fully functional CMS using the MERN stack (Mongo-Express-React-Node) to upload content

4. The user flow from the front end (logged out and logged in) experience to the back end use of data must be simple, bug-free and fully functional

5. The database should store 3-4 data-schemas

6. A minimum of one external API should be integrated

7. A complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) cycle must be integrated into the user experience and be tested, demonstrating test-driven-development

8. The project should be deployed (fully-working and bug-free) on Heroku

9. A README file should outline approach and how the project meets technical requirements


## Project Proposal:

**App Name:** booker

**Value Proposition:** A book sharing community - where users share their book collections by loaning out and borrowing books from other users

**Key Use Cases:** "As a user, I would like to...."

- register my details so that I can use the app and keep my details safe

- login and create, update or delete my user profile as the details change so that accurate information is stored in the app

- upload my books to the app and create a library of my books so that other users can borrow my books

- see other peoplesâ€™ books so that I may borrow books from their libraries

- confirm or reject a request to borrow the books in my library so that I retain control over who can borrow books from me

- know how far the books that I want to borrow are from me so that I can make decisions on whether I want to travel that far to get the book

- know the contact details of the owner of the books I want to borrow, so that I can arrange to pick the book up

- know the contact details of the borrower of my books I want to borrow, so that I can arrange the book pick up

- see the book title, author, reviews and ratings of books so that I can make decisions whether I would like to borrow the book or not

- easily view the books I have out on loan and the books I am loaning in one place, so that I can manage the books I am reading and keep track that all books that have been borrowed are returned in a timely fashion

## Team Organisation - Loose Agile Framework

- Team is self-organising
- Decisions are made democratically
- Trouble shoot early and often
- Support quickly and solve problem
- Seek to solve the problem with root cause analysis
- The whole team is responsible for positive outcomes and good quality code
- Interactions better than documentation

## Wins

- Key technologies used by everyone
- User journeys well mapped out and data-flows discussed in detail
- Good road-maps to map out back-log
- Testing started early
- Styling as we went rather than right at the end


## Challenges

- Creating the promise functions in the seeds file - figuring out the order of promises needed
- Creating the test files - had to create a proxy user to test functionality
- Nav bar bugs - challenges logging out users
- Figuring out search and filter functions in React - pulling data into the render function
- User profile - giving users the ability to set their own location using a map marker
- Loans - scoping features and functions to fit time lines
- Project management of roles and division of work - sprint rules difficult to follow for a one week project


## Project Roadmap

- Front-end user journeys
- Back-end configuration structure
- Data schemas  
- Product backlog

## Project Deliverables

### Front End

Set up

Authorisation files

  - Map files - for user to edit details and show user collections



#### Pages accessible by unregistered (not logged in) users:

| Page | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Home | / | Home page with app name/logo and tagline |
| About | /about | Value proposition/brief explanation |
| Books | /books | All collections by all book owners |
| Each book | /books/:id |  Displays details of the chosen book: <br> - Book title <br> - Author <br> - Rating and reviews <br> - Owner information <br> - Loan request functionality |
| Libraries | /libraries | Displays all libraries by location |
| Login | /login | Login for returning (registered) users |
| Register | /register | Registration for new users |

#### Pages only accessible by logged in users:

| Page | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Loans | /loans | Loan management page for books loaned out and books borrowed |
| My Profile | /users | Profile page of the user where they can view, update and delete their profile and library information |


#### Additional functionality for logged in users:

1. Logout _(returns user to the homepage)_
2. The CRUD Cycle for books

| CRUD Cycle | Route | HTTP Method | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Create | /books | POST | Users are directed to a blank form with the following: <br> - Text fields for title, author, image URL <br> - Select dropdown with options for genre <br> - Checkbox (styled as a toggle button) for non-/fiction <br> - Radio buttons for review <br> - Textarea for description and review |
| Read | /books <br> /books/:id | GET | Users are able to view information about the book(s) |
| Update | /books/:id/ | PUT | Users are directed to a pre-populated version of the Create form to change information |
  | Delete | /books/:id | DELETE | A remove button on the page prompts the user to confirm that they want to delete the book before permanently removing it from the database |

_Users will be returned to the books (path: /books) page on submit of create and update forms and when clicking the remove button or the back button on a /books/:id page._

3. Libraries page
  - Users are shown the location of their library with a blue marker (in comparison to red markers for other libraries)
  - A button links users to view/edit their profile



1. Books ( /books )
Added functionality
 - filter by owner
 - search by book title or author
 - the CRUD cycle (create, update, delete)
 - Logout (back to the home logged out page)

              _Add_ (/books/add) CR (create)
              _Edit_ (/books/id/update) U (update)
              _Remove_ (/books/id/update) D (delete)

              Add a book to collection as the authorised user
              - form fields
                 - Text fields for book by name, author, picture of the book, a description
                 - Toggle button - category
                 - Radio buttons - rating

            CREATE-  The submit button takes user back to Books page (/books)
            UPDATE - The submit button takes the user back to the Books page (/books/id)
            DELETE  - The remove button removes the book automatically and takes the user back to the Books page (/books)  

            _Borrow_  (/books/id/loan)

            Borrow books from owners
            -form fields
              - collect book (loan start) date
              - return book (loan end) date
              - message (text field) to owner

         The submit button takes the user back to the account page of the user (/loans)
         The back button takes the user back to the main page (/books)

         _Account_ (/loans)

         A status page that lists all the books that are loaned out and status as well as books that have been borrowed and status

### Back End

#### Configuration
 - [Environment](../master/config/environment.js) - set up for the environment, port, database URI and secret
 - [Routes](../master/config/routes.js) - pathways to the controller functions for the CRUD cycle

 ```
 // Example: Routes for /books and /books/:id
 // Note that some routes are secure and some are not

 router.route('/books')
   .get(books.booksAll)
   .post(secureRoute, books.bookCreate)

 router.route('/books/:id')
   .get(books.bookShow)
   .put(secureRoute, books.bookUpdate)
   .delete(secureRoute, books.bookDelete)

 ```

#### Controllers
 - [Authentication](../master/controllers/auth.js) - user login and registration functionality with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

 ```
 // Example: User registration (CRUD - Create)

 function register(req, res, next) {
   User
     .create(req.body)
     .then(user => {
       const token = jwt.sign({ sub: user._id }, secret, { expiresIn: '6h' })
       res.json({
         message: `Thanks for registering, ${user.username}`,
         token,
         user
       })
     })
     .catch(next)
 }
 ```

 - CRUD functionality for:
  - [Users](../master/controllers/users.js)

  ```
  // Example: Show information on a specific user (CRUD - Read)

  function userShow(req, res) {
    User
      .findById(req.params.id)
      .then(user => res.status(200).json(user))
      .catch(err => res.json(err))
  }

  ```

  - [Genres](../master/controllers/genres.js)

  ```
  // Example: Show all genres (CRUD - Read)

  function genresAll(req, res) {
    Genres
      .find()
      .then(genres => res.json(genres))
      .catch(e => console.log(e))
  }
  ```

  - [Books](../master/controllers/books.js), including reviews and ratings

  ```
  // Example: Delete a book (CRUD - Delete)

  function bookDelete(req, res) {
    Book
      .findByIdAndRemove(req.params.id)
      .then(() => res.sendStatus(204))
      .catch(err => res.status(500).json(err))
  }
  ```
  ```
  // Example: Add a book rating (CRUD - Create)

  function ratingAdd(req, res) {
    req.body.user = req.currentUser
    Book
      .findById(req.params.id)
      .populate('rating')
      .then(book => {
        book.rating.push(req.body)
        return book.save()
      })
      .then(book => res.json(book))
      .catch(err => res.status(422).json(err))
  }
  ```

  - [Loans](../master/controllers/loans.js)

  ```
  // Example: Update loan information (CRUD - Update)

  function loanUpdate(req, res) {
    Loan
      .findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, {new: true, runValidators: true})
      .exec()
      .then(loan => res.status(200).json(loan))
      .catch(err => res.status(500).json(err))
  }

  ```

 - Books functions for the CRUD cycle
 - CRUD js-functions for loans, books, genres, users to ensure get, post, put, delete functions run smoothly

#### Library
 - [Error handlers](../master/lib/errorHandler.js) for custom error messages and response statuses
 - [Secure route](../master/lib/secureRoute.js) functionality to restrict access by unregistered and not logged in users

#### Database
- [Seeds](../master/db/seeds.js) - To drop the current database and populate it with:
  - 11 users
  - 11 genres
  - 91 books
  - 24 loan requests


- Seeds promises - In the seeds file we used JavaScript promises to ensure that the database is always seeded in the correct order. This is because certain data models require others to exist before they can be created:
  - Books can only be created once users (book owners) and genres have been created
  - Loans can only be created once users and books have been created

  ```
  // Create users and genres inside a promise array
  const promiseArray = [
    User.create([...]),
    BookGenre.create([...])
  ]

  // Wait for all promises to pass before continuing
  Promise.all(promiseArray)
    .then(data => {
      // Deconstruct data so that users and genres can be used when creating books
      const [ users, genres ] = data
      return Promise.all([
        Books.create([...]),
        // Along with books, pass users down to the next then block
        users
        ])
      })
    .then(data => {
      // Deconstruct data so that books and users can be used when creating loans
      const [ books, users ] = data
      return Loan.create([...])
    })
  ```


- Data Models/Schemas
  - [User](../master/models/user.js) - login/authentication credentials, as well as profile and library information
  ```
  const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    profilePicture: { type: String},
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    libraryName: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    location: {
      lat: { type: Number, required: true },
      lng: { type: Number, required: true }
    },
    libraryPicture: { type: String},
    libraryDescription: { type: String },
    userRating: [ userRatingSchema ]
  }, {
    timestamps: true
  })
  ```
    - Virtual fields were also included for books, loans and password confirmation

  - [Genre](../master/models/bookGenre.js) - a simple schema containing one string for the genre name/title
  ```
  const bookGenreSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    genre: { type: String, required: true }
  })
  ```
    - Genres were created separately from books so that the list could be scaled up as required

  - [Book](../master/models/book.js) - book information with references to the BookGenre and User schemas, as well as information for book ratings and reviews
  ```
  const ratingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    rating: {type: Number, min: 1, max: 5},
    user: {type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User',  autopopulate: true }
  })
  ```
  ```
  const reviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    review: {type: String},
    user: {type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', autopopulate: true }
  })
  ```
  ```
  const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: {type: String, required: true},
    authors: {type: String},
    image: {type: String},
    fiction: {type: Boolean, required: true},
    genre: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'BookGenre'},
    description: {type: String},
    rating: [ratingSchema],
    review: [reviewSchema],
    owner: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', autopopulate: true }
  })
  ```
    - Virtual fields were used for book loans

  - [Loan](../master/models/loan.js) - loan information with references to the Book and User schemas
  ```
  const loanSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    book: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Book'},
    borrower: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User'},
    start: { type: Date, required: true},
    end: { type: Date, required: true},
    message: { type: String },
    approved: { type: Boolean },
    declined: { type: Boolean },
    collected: { type: Date },
    returned: { type: Date}
  }, {
    timestamps: true
  })
  ```
